# THETA Stack

This repository serves as a template for kick-starting web apps using a simple stack that I found I like.

- **T**urso: Dead simple edge DB with sqlite
- **H**tmx: All my homies HATEOAS
- **E**cho: Fantastically simple Golang web framework
- **T**ailwind: Because I'm too lazy to write CSS myself
- **A**lpineJS: For writing even less JS myself

## Getting Started

This thing isn't even done yet. Lemme cook for a bit.
